## Mid Project Check in

Jee Hyun Kim & TJ Kim

We accomplished our goals. We successfully understood the entire dataset, and thorougly filtered it to rid of any data not relevant for our process or had too many null values. With the filtered dataframe, we developed an algorithm. We decided upon specific user inputs, and developed algorithms and further filtering process. The final filtered output is the list of colleges that are relevant to the user's interests. 

We develoepd a sketch of what we want the final outcome to be. Although we were striving for a visual representation initially, the thorough application of the algorithm also makes the theoretical final output very useful as an app. We will have drawings of what we desire to be our final visual output. As a step towards the final output, we have begun to visualize the output data. We will bring the drawings of final representatiosn to class. 

So far what we have accomplished can be best represented by the following ipython notebook at "https://github.com/tj-kim/DataScience16CTW/blob/master/alg_finalized_1_1.ipynb". The notebook holds the functions that hold the algorithm of using user input to recommend college. The code that filters out the initial grand dataset to just what is useful can be found at "https://github.com/tj-kim/DataScience16CTW/blob/master/new_data_csv_book.ipynb". Visual representations are currently under progress, but initial sketchmodels on paper will be brought to class for further brainstorming and discussion.

Our minimum viable product is still a JPG or PNG of a visual representation of a recommended college. Our stretch goal is to create a fluid visual interface that allows the user to input their preferences in a nice organized gui, that creates the JPG or PNG. A further stretch goal is to create an interactive graph, where the user can potentially hover over the graph with a mouse to get further information on certain parts, such as school information.
